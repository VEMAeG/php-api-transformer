## Purpose
This library provides the core functionality for API transformation. As a base library, by itself it's not usable at all.

## Used by

Currently the following transformers make use of this library as foundation:

- [nilportugues/json](https://github.com/nilportugues/json-transformer)
- [nilportugues/jsend](https://github.com/nilportugues/jsend-transformer)
- [nilportugues/haljson](https://github.com/nilportugues/hal-json-transformer)
- [nilportugues/json-api](https://github.com/nilportugues/jsonapi-transformer)


## Quality

To run the PHPUnit tests at the command line, go to the tests directory and issue phpunit.

This library attempts to comply with [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/), [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) and [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/).

If you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.
